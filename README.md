# BABACHI: Background Allelic Dosage Bayesian Checkpoint Identification
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/255952669.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/255952669) <br>
BABACHI is a tool for estimation of relative Background Allelic Dosage (BAD) from
non-phased heterozygous SNVs. It estimates BAD directly from enriched sequencing data, where
the precise estimation of allelic copy numbers is not possible.

BAD corresponds to the ratio of Major allele copy number to Minor allele copy number. More details and algorithm description are available [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23007-0)

## Files format
BABACHI accepts either a BED file with heterozygous SNVs or a standard VCF file sorted by genomic positions (ascending).
- a BED file should begin with the following 8 columns; additional columns are permitted and ignored:
```chromosome, start, end, ID, reference base, alterntive base, reference read count, alternative read count, sample_id```.<br>
Lines starting with # are ignored.

- a VCF file should have GT and AD fields. 

(!) We suggest to use only <b>common SNPs</b> for BAD estimation. User is expected to filter common variants prior to BABACHI usage. See [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23007-0) for more details.

The output is a BED file with BAD annotations. The file format is described in the [Demo](#demo) section

## Demo
To perform a test run:
```
babachi --test
```
The test run takes approximately 2 minutes on a standard computer.
<br>
The result is a file named `test.bed` that will be created in the working directory (if `-O` option was not provided).
The contents of the `test.bed` file should have the following format:
```
#chr	start	end	BAD	Q1.00	Q1.33	Q1.50	Q2.00	Q2.50	Q3.00	Q4.00	Q5.00	Q6.00	SNP_count	sum_cover
chr1	1	125183196	2	-63.47825919524621	-24.598710473939718	-8.145646624117944	-2.000888343900442e-11	-30.773041699645546	-78.80480783186977	-189.88685134708248	-299.82657588596703	-401.6012195141575	1325	17280
```
Each row represents a single segment with a constant estimated BAD. The most important columns are:
- \#chr:  chromosome
- start: segment start position
- end: segment end position
- BAD: estimated BAD score

Additional columns:
- SNP_count: number of SNPs in the segment
- SNP_ID_count: number of unique SNPs in the segment
- sum_cover: the total read coverage of all SNPs of the segment
- Q<b>X</b>: the logarithmic likelihood of the segment to have BAD = <b>X</b> 

The BABACHI tool is maintained by Sergey Abramov and Alexandr Boytsov.
